# LizWiz OS
Welcome fellow dev to the LizWiz OS repository. This is my second repository for LizWiz (full name Lizard Wizard OS), this one is also developed in rust, but with more planning ahead and  by following `OSdev` instead of `Writing an OS in Rust`.
First of all, why am i developing an OS? to answer that question, i am just really interested in OS's right now. In fact, it probably is a new hyperfixation for me. I am generally interested in low level systems anyways, i've tried to develop a interpreter or two before,
and i've tried to make a compiler once. Now it's time for an OS.

Since my way of developing is kind of a trial and error thing, where i either lose interest in a project for a while or hit a wall, and stop developing the project for a while, i am planning to create a decent way of managing my code. Previous projects have all ran into a dead
end because i didn't know where to start after a while. for this project i will make a branch where all my functional code will go, one where i can push in development features to and some branches to develop different modules in etc.
